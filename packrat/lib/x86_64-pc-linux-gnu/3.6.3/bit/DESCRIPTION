Description: True boolean datatype (no NAs), coercion from and to
    logicals, integers and integer subscripts; fast boolean operators
    and fast summary statistics. With 'bit' vectors you can store true
    binary booleans {FALSE,TRUE} at the expense of 1 bit only, on a 32
    bit architecture this means factor 32 less RAM and ~ factor 32 more
    speed on boolean operations. Due to overhead of R calls, actual
    speed gain depends on the size of the vector: expect gains for
    vectors of size > 10000 elements. Even for one-time boolean
    operations it can pay-off to convert to bit, the pay-off is
    obvious, when such components are used more than once. Reading from
    and writing to bit is approximately as fast as accessing standard
    logicals - mostly due to R's time for memory allocation. The
    package allows to work with pre-allocated memory for return values
    by calling .Call() directly: when evaluating the speed of C-access
    with pre-allocated vector memory, coping from bit to logical
    requires only 70% of the time for copying from logical to logical;
    and copying from logical to bit comes at a performance penalty of
    150%. the package now contains further classes for representing
    logical selections: 'bitwhich' for very skewed selections and 'ri'
    for selecting ranges of values for chunked processing. All three
    index classes can be used for subsetting 'ff' objects (ff-2.1-0 and
    higher).
