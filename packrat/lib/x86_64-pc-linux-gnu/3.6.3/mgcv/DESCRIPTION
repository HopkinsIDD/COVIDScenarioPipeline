Title: Mixed GAM Computation Vehicle with Automatic Smoothness
    Estimation
Description: Generalized additive (mixed) models, some of their
    extensions and other generalized ridge regression with multiple
    smoothing parameter estimation by (Restricted) Marginal Likelihood,
    Generalized Cross Validation and similar, or using iterated nested
    Laplace approximation for fully Bayesian inference. See Wood (2017)
    <doi:10.1201/9781315370279> for an overview. Includes a gam()
    function, a wide variety of smoothers, 'JAGS' support and
    distributions beyond the exponential family.
