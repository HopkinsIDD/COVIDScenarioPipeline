Description: Bindings to OpenSSL libssl and libcrypto, plus custom SSH
    key parsers. Supports RSA, DSA and EC curves P-256, P-384, P-521,
    and curve25519. Cryptographic signatures can either be created and
    verified manually or via x509 certificates. AES can be used in cbc,
    ctr or gcm mode for symmetric encryption; RSA for asymmetric
    (public key) encryption or EC for Diffie Hellman. High-level
    envelope functions combine RSA and AES for encrypting arbitrary
    sized data. Other utilities include key generators, hash functions
    (md5, sha1, sha256, etc), base64 encoder, a secure random number
    generator, and 'bignum' math methods for manually performing crypto
    calculations on large multibyte integers.
