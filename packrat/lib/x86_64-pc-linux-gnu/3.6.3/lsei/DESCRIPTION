Description: It contains functions that solve least squares linear
    regression problems under linear equality/inequality constraints.
    Functions for solving quadratic programming problems are also
    available, which transform such problems into least squares ones
    first. It is developed based on the 'Fortran' program of Lawson and
    Hanson (1974, 1995), which is public domain and available at
