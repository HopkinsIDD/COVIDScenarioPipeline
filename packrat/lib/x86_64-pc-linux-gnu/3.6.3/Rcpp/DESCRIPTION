Description: The 'Rcpp' package provides R functions as well as C++
    classes which offer a seamless integration of R and C++. Many R
    data types and objects can be mapped back and forth to C++
    equivalents which facilitates both writing of new code as well as
    easier integration of third-party libraries. Documentation about
    'Rcpp' is provided by several vignettes included in this package,
    via the 'Rcpp Gallery' site at <http://gallery.rcpp.org>, the paper
    by Eddelbuettel and Francois (2011, <doi:10.18637/jss.v040.i08>),
    the book by Eddelbuettel (2013, <doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-6868-4>)
    and the paper by Eddelbuettel and Balamuta (2018,
    <doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1375990>); see 'citation("Rcpp")' for
    details.
