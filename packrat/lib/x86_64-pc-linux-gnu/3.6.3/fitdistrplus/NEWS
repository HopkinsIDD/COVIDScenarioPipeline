Version 1.0-12
=============
BUG FIXES
- bug fixed in qmedist() and fitdistcens() which raised an error in checkparamlist().

- add of a part dedicated to censored datain the FAQ vignette.
- homogeneization of xlim and ylim default definition in plotdistcens.

- vignette updated to the version of a paper accepted by the 
Journal of Statistical Software.
- add of an argument discrete in fitdist in order to be able to take into

inflate Poisson distribution).
- add of an S3 class for descdist and a print method.

or both superimposed.
- a strong warning was added to the documentation of function descdist
about the problematic high variance of skewness and kurtosis.

Version 1.0-1
=============

NEW FEATURES

- add of an argument Turnbull.confint to functions plotdistcens and cdfcompcens in order to 
    draw confidence intervals on the empirical distribution only if requested.
- ppoints now used in "fitdist" for QQ plot, PP plot and cdf plot for continuous data
    (was used only for QQ plot in previous versions) to enable Blom type plotting position
    (using by default Hazen plotting position than can be chanfge using arguments use.ppoints and a.ppoints)
- many changes in the examples given in the reference manual.

BUG FIXES
- correction the formula for the CvM test for Weibull distribution.
- elimination of CvM and AD tests for normal, lognormal and logistic distributions : 
formulas previously used (given by Stephens 1986) do not use exactly MLE estimates and thus
results were only approximates.
- make arguments xlim and ylim functional in cdfcompcens.
- bug fix in the closed formula in mmedist for lognormal distributions.

Version 0.3-4
=============

NEW FEATURES
- posibility to fix xlegend to a keyword (e.g. "bottomright") in "cdfcomp" and "cdfcompdens".
- improvement of the new vignette.

BUG FIXES
- correction of the NAMESPACE file in order to enable the correct print of a summary of a fitdistcens object
(with the correlation matrix, the loglikelihood and AIC and BIC statistics).

Version 0.3-3

censored data set.

to function survfit{survival}.

Version 0.3-1
=============

NEW FEATURES
- add of a draft of a new version of the vignette.

Version 0.3-0
=============

NEW FEATURES
- a new function ("cdfcomp") to plot cumulative distributions corresponding to various fits using a same 
non censored data set.
- add of two data sets : "endosulfan" and "toxocara".

Version 0.2-2
=============

BUG FIXES

- elimination of NON-ASCII characters in the vignette.

Version 0.2-1
=============

NEW FEATURES
- a new fitting method was implemented for continuous distributions : the maximum goodness-of-fit
estimation (function "mgedist") (for the moment only available for non censored data).

Version 0.1-5
=============

NEW FEATURES
- a new goodness-of-fit statistic was added in gofstat, with corresponding test :
the Cramer-von Mises distance.
- a new fitting method has been implemented : the quantile matching estimation (function "qmedist").
For the moment, only available for non censored data.
- the moment matching estimation has been extended (in function mmedist) to enable numerical
matching when closed formula are not available.

BUG FIXES

- correction of a bug inserted while adding the argument "fix.arg" which prevent the print of the
results of goodness-of-fit tests.


Version 0.1-4
=============

NEW FEATURES
- a component named dots added to the list returned by fitdist and fitdistcens in order to pass optional arguments
for the control of optimization in mledist to bootdist and bootdistcens. bootdist and bootdistcens
changed to take into account these optional arguments if they are defined in the call to fitdist or fitdistcens.
- an argument added to fitdist, fitdistcens and mledist, named fix.arg, and giving the possibility to fix some
of the distribution parameters while maximizing the likelihood. Functions bootdist, bootdistcens and gofstat were also
changed in order to take this new argument into account.
- a new data file of bacterial contamination censored data extracted from Busschaert et al. 2000 and examples
corresponding to analysis of this dataset.

BUG FIXES

- correction of a bug in the print and the plot of bootstraped samples using bootdist or bootdistcens
when there was only one parameter estimated by maximum likelihood.

Version 0.1-3
=============

NEW FEATURES
- new data file "groundbeef" (groundbeef.rda and groundbeef.Rd) and new use of this dataset in some examples.
- new function gofstat.
    Goodness-of-fit statistics are no more computed by fitdist but may computed and printed
    by the use of the function gofstat. In this new function, the whole results computed are not printed :
    results of tests are printed only if the argument print.test==TRUE and for continuous distributions
    only Anderson-Darling and Kolomogorov-Smirnov statistics are printed by default (but complete results
    are returned by gofstat).
- modifications in descdist : three arguments were added in descdist
    1/ method, to choose between unbiased estimations
    of standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis (default choice) and
    sample values.
    2/ obs.col to choose the color used to plot the observed point on the graph.
    3/ boot.col to choose the color used to plot the bootstrap sample of points on the graph.
- modifications in plotfit : minor changes were performed in order to facilitate the use of the argument ...
    to personnalize the plots (see examples in plotdist.Rd)
- modication of the vignette

BUG FIXES

- correction of a bug in plotdist due to the redefinition in the previous version
    of the parameter "ylim" for the plot of a histogram with theoretical density function
    (there was a problem with infinite values of theoretical density function).

Version 0.1-2
=============

NEW FEATURES

- deletion of mledistcens and modification of mledist in order
to maximize likelihood for both censored and non censored data.
- possibility to choose the optimization method used for maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) of distribution parameters using the new
argument "optim.method" of mledist.
- possibility to specify contraints on distribution parameters using
the new arguments "lower" and "upper" of mledist.
- possibility to use a custom optimization function for MLE using the
new argument "custom.optim".
- moment matching estimation is no longer done with argument method
set to "mom" but set to "mme" in fitdist.
- renaming of momdist in mmedist.
- calculation of AIC and BIC criterion after maximum likelihood
estimation of distribution parameters
- change of the default number of iterations from 999 to 1001
for bootstrap in order to avoid interpolation using the quantile function
- use of the argument "log" and (resp. "log.p") of density (resp.
distribution) when available to compute the loglikelihood.

BUG FIXES

- omitting the name of the first argument in calls to the density function
during maximization of the likelihood in order to enable the use of a density
function defined with a first parameter (the vector of quantiles) with a name
differing from "x" (classical name for density distributions defined in R),
such as the density function dexGAUS from the package gamlss.dist.


Version 0.1-1
=============

- Initial release.
