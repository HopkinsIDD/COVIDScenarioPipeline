Package: R6
Title: Encapsulated Classes with Reference Semantics
Version: 2.4.1
Authors@R: person("Winston", "Chang", role = c("aut", "cre"), email =
    "winston@stdout.org")
Description: Creates classes with reference semantics, similar to R's
    built-in reference classes. Compared to reference classes, R6
    classes are simpler and lighter-weight, and they are not built on
    S4 classes so they do not require the methods package. These
    classes allow public and private members, and they support
    inheritance, even when the classes are defined in different
    packages.
Depends: R (>= 3.0)
Suggests: knitr, microbenchmark, pryr, testthat, ggplot2, scales
