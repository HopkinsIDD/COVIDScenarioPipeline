Description: Carries out mapping between assorted color spaces
    including RGB, HSV, HLS, CIEXYZ, CIELUV, HCL (polar CIELUV), CIELAB
    and polar CIELAB. Qualitative, sequential, and diverging color
    palettes based on HCL colors are provided along with corresponding
    ggplot2 color scales. Color palette choice is aided by an
    interactive app (with either a Tcl/Tk or a shiny GUI) and shiny
    apps with an HCL color picker and a color vision deficiency
    emulator. Plotting functions for displaying and assessing palettes
    include color swatches, visualizations of the HCL space, and
    trajectories in HCL and/or RGB spectrum. Color manipulation
    functions include: desaturation, lightening/darkening, mixing, and
    simulation of color vision deficiencies (deutanomaly, protanomaly,
    tritanomaly).
