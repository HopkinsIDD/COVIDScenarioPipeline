To add or update a package on the dev Docker using packrat:

1) Run the docker with COVIDScenarioPipeline mounted

docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/home/app/covidsp hopkinsidd/covidscenariopipeline:latest-dev

2) Install the packages you want using R normally, such as install.packages(...)

3) Run packrat::snapshot(infer.dependencies=FALSE)
3a) Go do something else for about an hour. This could take awhile.

4) Delete the lib and src files.

cd ~/packrat
rm -r lib*

5) Packrat does not delete old *.tar.gz's in the src folder. Try to remove the ones for packages you updated (if any). Cross-reference the hashes with the ones in packrat.lock.

6) Copy all files from the /home/app/packrat directory to the mounted /home/app/covidsp/packrat directory.
