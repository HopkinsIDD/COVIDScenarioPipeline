The model results here are the results of a modeling pipeline 
that moves from a seeding phase, through epidemic simulation,
a outcome and hospitalization generation engine, and report 
generation. Core code for all aspects of the pipeline 
is all open source. The core pipeline phases are:


* **Seeding:** We run a model to determine the likelihood of importing
  cases into the region of interest. We maintain an [R
  package](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/covidImportation).

* **Epidemic Simulation:** We run a location stratified [SEIR
  model](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/COVIDScenarioPipeline/tree/dataseed/SEIR),
  using a python module in `COVIDScenarioPipeline`.
  
* **Hospitalization and Outcome Generator:** We estimate secondary
  effects of infection using infection numbers using the
  [hospitalization](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/COVIDScenarioPipeline/tree/dataseed/R/pkgs/hospitalization)
  R package in `COVIDScenarioPipeline`.

* **Report Generation:** We provide functions to access results and
  help produce reports in the
  [report_generation](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/COVIDScenarioPipeline/tree/dataseed/R/pkgs/report_generation)
  R package in `COVIDScenarioPipeline`.
