The model is an stochastic spatial 'SEIR model' where the population of
each node is divided in categories depending on their situation with
regard to the diseases. The compartments are:

-   $S$ Susceptible individuals that may contracts COVID-19.

-   $E$ Exposed individuals that are incubating the disease, after being
    in contact with another infected.

-   $I$ Infected and infectious individuals.

-   $R$ Recovered individuals with immunity to re-infection.

In practice, this translate into $k = 3$ compartments of infected,
$I1, I2, I3$ in order to have an infectious period shaped as Erlang
distribution. Then the rates of the different compartments are given in
the table below:

  -------------------------- -------------------------------------- ----------
          Transition                     rate parameter                Unit
     $S\longrightarrow E$     $\beta = \frac{R_0 \cdot \gamma}{k}$   d$^{-1}$
    $E\longrightarrow I_1$          $\sigma = \frac{1}{5.2}$         d$^{-1}$
   $I_1\longrightarrow I_2$       $\gamma = \gamma_s \cdot k$        d$^{-1}$
   $I_2\longrightarrow I_3$       $\gamma = \gamma_s \cdot k$        d$^{-1}$
    $I_3\longrightarrow R$        $\gamma = \gamma_s \cdot k$        d$^{-1}$
  -------------------------- -------------------------------------- ----------

For such epidemiological model, two meta-parameters are important in
reproducing the dynamics and final size of an epidemic: the serial
interval $SI$, which is the interval between two subsequent infections,
and the basic reproductive number $R_0$ representing the number of newly
infected per infected, in a fully susceptible population. For our model, we
assume that the serial interval is the sum of the incubation period
and half of the infectious period.

The serial interval of COVID-19 is currently estimated to be in range
$6.5-8.2$. We draw uniformly from this range, and we solve
$SI = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{\gamma\cdot k})+\frac{1}{\sigma}$ for
$\gamma$.

The basic reproductive number, $R_0$, is drawn for each simulation and we obtain parameter beta from
$\beta= \frac{R_0 \cdot \gamma}{k}$.

The model is fixed time step, and the transitions at each time step
$\Delta t$ are: $$\begin{aligned}
p_{expose} &=&  1 - \exp(-\Delta t \cdot \beta \cdot \frac{I_1 + I_2 + I_3}{H}) \\
p_{infect} &=&  1 - \exp(-\Delta t \cdot \sigma)\\
p_{recover} &=& 1 - \exp(-\Delta t \cdot \gamma)\end{aligned}$$

At each time step, we draw in a binomial distribution, e.g
$$N_{I_1\longrightarrow I_2}(t) = \text{Binom}(I_1, 1 - \exp(-\delta t \cdot \gamma))$$

Individuals moves from one node to another. A mobility matrix $M$ where
$M(o,d)$ is the amount of individuals moving daily from origin $o$ to
destination $d$. At each time step, and for each $(o,d)$ pair, we draw:
$$N_{o\longrightarrow d} = \text{Binom}((S_o,E_o,I^1_o,I^2_o,I^3_o,R_o)^T, 1 - \exp(\frac{-\Delta t * M(o,d)}{H_o}))$$
For each compartment, $N_{o\longrightarrow d}$ is the amount of
individual we displace from $o$ to $d$. $H_o$ is the total population of
node $o$

The model is implemented in python, just in time compiled to machine
code using Numba. It runs at the county level.
