We used a global air importation model in conjunction with global cumulative confirmed COVID case data from [JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data Portal](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) and assumptions in recent travel reductions to estimate the number of COVID case importations into major airports located in `r report_loc` and surrounding areas (`r paste(modeled_states, collapse = ", ")`) from January through March. These estimated global importations were used to seed our epidemic model.

If the number of infections in any single county was below the number of confirmed cases reported by the JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data Portal on a given day between February 1 and March 18, the simulation was stopped and removed from the model results. We ran 1000 model simulations from `r print_pretty_date(sim_start_date)` through `r print_pretty_date(sim_end_date)` for each scenario. Some outcomes may be reported beyond the simulation period in order to examine the full disease course for infections occurring at the end of the simulation period.
