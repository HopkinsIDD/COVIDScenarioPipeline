We seeded the epidemic with roughly 10x the number of confirmed cases reported by the [JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data Portal](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) for the five days prior to the first confirmed cases into each county in Louisiana. We ran 1000 model simulations from `r print_pretty_date(sim_start_date)` through `r print_pretty_date(sim_end_date)` for each scenario. Some outcomes may be reported beyond the simulation period in order to examine the full disease course for infections occurring at the end of the simulation period.
